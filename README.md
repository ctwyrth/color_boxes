# color_boxes

Just a simple HTML, CSS, Javascript project to play with randomization and intervals.

Clicking the button at the bottome of the page engages the function that cycles through the divs on the page to change the background color by generating a random hexidecimal value. The next iteration would be to make the boxes morph as well as chnage color through the use of a grid.

Pieces of this code are from Brian Design's YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNIlt7_oMQQ).
